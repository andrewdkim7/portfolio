# Tableau Projects

This folder contains Tableau visualizations I have created! I only recently taught myself the foundations of Tableau after discovering its utility for appealing visualizations and intend to use it to present my findings from my current project: text-classification of U.S. state constitutions and analysis of constitutional language effects on state civic culture/electoral practices. I anticipate completing this by August 2024!

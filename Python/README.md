# Python Projects

This folder contains projects I've completed in Python!

My current personal Python project will web scrape and parse the text of state constitutions, evaluate each text's contents with a kNN classifier, then statistically evaluate how these contents relate to a state's civic culture/electoral practices.

I anticipate completing this project by August 2024!

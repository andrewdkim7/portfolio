# Python Projects

This folder contains projects I've completed in Python!

It's currently empty because the brunt of my Python projects have been for direct coursework, but my current personal project will web scrape and parse the text of state constitutions, evaluate each text's contents with a kNN classifier, then statistically evaluate how these contents relate to a state's civic culture/electoral practices.

I anticipate completing this project by August 2024!

# Python Projects

This folder contains projects I've completed in Python!

**LetterboxdWebScraping.ipynb (Summer 2024)** - web scrape of 171 Letterboxd film review pages to provide data for analysis in SQL

My current Python project will web scrape the contents of U.S. state ballot measures, as well as other data such as issue advocacy spending, election rules, and voter demographics to train a model analyzing the text of and predicting support for new ballot measures. I anticipate completing this project by August 2024!

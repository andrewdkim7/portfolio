# Python Projects

This folder contains projects I've completed in Python!

**LetterboxdWebScraping.ipynb (Summer 2024)** - web scrape of 171 Letterboxd film review pages to provide data for analysis in SQL

My current personal Python project will web scrape and parse the text of state constitutions, evaluate each text's contents with a kNN classifier, then statistically evaluate how these contents relate to a state's civic culture. I anticipate completing this project by August 2024!

<h1 id="hi-there-i-m-andrew-">Hi there, I&#39;m Andrew!</h1>
<h2 id="_i-like-data-and-policy-_"><em>I like data and policy.</em></h2>
<p>I&#39;m a recent graduate of Rice University, where I studied social policy analysis and data science. Drawing on my experience in quantiative policy research and leading community initiatives, I&#39;m keen to apply my analytical skills to advance democratic, equity-driven policymaking.</p>

<p><strong>Current Project:</strong> Geospatial and demographic analysis of inequities in NYC historic landmark designation, culminating in public dashboard and toolkit to support community-driven nominations as form of civic representation</p>

<p><strong>Featured Projects:</strong>
<li>Administration and analysis of nationwide survey (N = 1,792) on U.S. residents' constitutional attitudes in <strong>R</strong>, using factor analysis and multivariate regression to discern multidimensionality of constitutional respect <a href="#veneration">(jump to section)</a></li>
<li>Geospatial interpolation models in <strong>Python</strong> to estimate small particle air pollution in at-risk Houston neighborhoods via map interface for publication by Houston Chronicle <a href="#air-pollution">(jump to section)</a></li>
<li>Gradient-boosted tree and linear regression models in <strong>Python</strong> to predict voter support for and abstentions from U.S. state ballot measures, utilizing web-scraped data (with Selenium and Beautiful Soup) on ballot language, campaign spending, demographics, etc. <a href="#in-pursuit-of-direct-democracy">(jump to section)</a></li>
